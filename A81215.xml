            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here are two great troublers of our peace, &amp; hinderers of our keeping the precepts of God, The fir≈øt is, violence of corruption within; the ≈øecond is, oppre≈ø≈øion without, In the ver≈øe before the Text, <hi>David</hi> prayeth for help again≈øt the former hinderance, namely, the violence of corruption within, <hi>Let not any iniquitie have dominion over mee,</hi> hee prayeth for help again≈øt the latter in the words now read, <hi>Deliver mee from the oppre≈ø≈øion of man, ≈øo will I keep thy precepts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, Wee have here <hi>Davids</hi> prayer for delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, <hi>Deliver mee from the oppre≈ø≈øion of man,</hi> oppre≈ø≈øion is the matter of it.</p>
            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:117437:4"/>
            <p>Secondly, Wee have <hi>Davids</hi> engagement, or his vow upon ≈øuppo≈øal of an an≈øwer to his prayers, <hi>So will I keep thy precepts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Deliver mee,</hi> that is, redeem, re≈øcue me, oppre≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is bondage, deliverance from oppre≈ø≈øion is free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, great deliverance hath Chri≈øt obtained for us, deliverance from ≈øinne, and deliverance from Hell, and this goeth under the name of redemption from the oppre≈ø≈øion of man; that is, from the oppre≈ø≈øion that man hath brought upon mee, or from oppre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing man; oppre≈ø≈øion in general is any wrong done to man by man: But more di≈øtinct, oppre≈ø≈øion may be con≈øidered, either in reference to the manner, or the matter of oppre≈ø≈øing, in reference to the manner, when it is violently and openly done, when men come boldly and oppre≈ø≈øe us. It is ≈øaid of <hi>Nymrod,</hi> that hee was a mighty Hunter before the Lord, hee was a Hunter of Bea≈øts, but more e≈øpecially a Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of men, Oppre≈ø≈øion in Scripture is often compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to hunting, in regard of the fiercene≈ø≈øe of it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, There are ≈øecret and cunning oppre≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which the Prophet <hi>Ho≈øen</hi> ≈øpeakes of in the 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of that Prophe≈øie, 7. ver≈øe, ≈øaith hee, hee is a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, the ballance of deceipt is in his hand, hee lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth to oppre≈ø≈øe, who was this? ≈øaith hee, hee is a Merchant. As ≈øome oppre≈ø≈øe with a ≈øword in their hands, that is, violently and openly, come deliver up your e≈øtates or libertie, or deliver up your life? ≈øo is it with a paire of ballances in the hand. Ballan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are put in a Synechdoche, for all the commerce betwixt man and man, now ≈øaith hee, here is one
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:117437:4"/> that oppre≈ø≈øeth with Ballances in his hand; he tels you you ≈øhall have penny for penny, bargain for bargain: yet, ≈øaith he, he is an oppre≈ø≈øor, he loves to oppre≈ø≈øe.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, You may di≈øtingui≈øh of Oppre≈ø≈øion, in regard of the matter of it, thus: in the fir≈øt place, Po≈øitive oppre≈ø≈øion, as in taking away from a man that which is his: ≈øecondly, Negative oppre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion, in with-holding that from a man which of right belongs unto him: <hi>Thou ≈øhalt not oppre≈ø≈øe the hyred ≈øervant, thou ≈øhalt pay him his wages at the day,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Deut.</hi> 24. 14. Againe, you may con≈øider Oppre≈ø≈øion, in regard of the matter of it, and ≈øo it is two-fold: fir≈øt, there is Civill oppre≈ø≈øion; ≈øecondly, there is Spirituall oppre≈ø≈øion.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, Civill oppre≈ø≈øion is, when the matter is in civill things; and you may divide it either to oppre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion of our e≈øtate, or oppre≈ø≈øion of our per≈øons, <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah 9. 37. The Kings that thou ha≈øt ≈øet over us for our ≈øinnes, have dominion over us:</hi> What dominion is this? It was a dominion over their per≈øons, and over their e≈øtates, at their will.</p>
            <p>Secondly, There is Spirituall oppre≈ø≈øion, and that is of the Con≈øcience, when there are things impo≈øed upon the Con≈øcience, which God hath not made; tho≈øe things which are of mans making, to impo≈øe upon Con≈øcience. Thus the Scribes and Phari≈øes were great oppre≈ø≈øors, they oppre≈ø≈øed mens ≈øpirits, they did bind heavie burthens, and layd them upon mens ≈øhoulders, but they them≈øelves would not touch them with their little finger. Thus Antichri≈øt is the great Oppre≈ø≈øor, and hence the Seat of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chri≈øt
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:117437:5"/> hath three Names given it in Scripture, <hi>Sodom, Egypt,</hi> and <hi>Babylon:</hi> and here <hi>David</hi> prayeth, to be delivered from the oppre≈ø≈øion of man.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>So will I keepe thy Precepts:</hi> I will doe it. He ≈øpeaks re≈øolutely, and yet he did not depend upon his own ≈øtrength. What is our ≈øtrength and our will? Alas, it is nothing: but wee may ≈øay ≈øo, as wee are under a Covenant of Grace, and a≈ø≈øi≈øtance from God, <hi>So will I keepe.</hi> The word which wee render here, <hi>to keepe,</hi> it ≈øignifieth to keepe a thing ≈øo, as to yeeld to it, obey it, and ≈øubmit to it: ≈øecondly, it ≈øignifieth to keepe a thing ≈øo, as to maintaine it, or protect it. <hi>I will keepe thy Precepts,</hi> ≈øaith <hi>David;</hi> that is, I will ≈øubmit to them, and obey them: or thus, I will keepe them, I will maintaine them, I will pre≈øerve them. So it is u≈øed, <hi>P≈øal. 116. 2. The Lord pre≈øerves the ≈øimple,</hi> or, he keepes the ≈øimple: Hee doth not meane by the ≈øimple, the man that is a foole, that hath no wi≈ødome or under≈øtanding; but the ≈øimple man, is a man of a ≈øimple heart, that hath no windings or doublings in his ≈øpirit: this is the man that is under the protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Lord. So it may be taken both wayes. By <hi>Precepts</hi> wee mu≈øt under≈øtand the whole revealed will of God, not onely Precepts of working, but Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of beleeving, it comprehends all: There are Precepts concerning things to be done, and Precepts concerning things to be beleeved: tho≈øe Precepts which are to be done, are ≈øuch as wee mu≈øt u≈øe in our ordinarie conver≈øation, the≈øe are Precepts of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe; and then there are Precepts of Truth, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to Doctrine, what wee are to beleeve.</p>
            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:117437:5"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But, may ≈øome ≈øay, did not <hi>David</hi> keepe the Precepts of God before?</p>
            <p>I an≈øwer, Yes: <hi>David</hi> had kept the Precepts of God before; for the Lord ≈øpeakes of him as a man after his owne heart, who would fulfill all his will. What then is the meaning of this expre≈ø≈øion, <hi>Deliver me from the oppre≈ø≈øion of man?</hi> The meaning is this; Deliver me from the oppre≈ø≈øion of man, ≈øo ≈øhall I have a better opportunitie to keepe thy Precepts. There are two great hinderances of the ≈øervice of God, as you have heard before, ≈øinne within, and oppre≈ø≈øion of man without. Againe, he meanes, I will keepe them more then I have done before; I will not live as formerly I have done: I have walked in the wayes of thy Commandements before, but now I will runne: This is the meaning of that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øion, <hi>Deliver me from the oppre≈ø≈øion of man, ≈øo will I keepe thy Precepts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 2. But, may ≈øome ≈øay, if God would not deliver <hi>David,</hi> would not he keepe his Precepts?</p>
            <p>For an≈øwer to this: <hi>David</hi> did not indent with God, and ≈øay, if God would not deliver him, then he would not keepe his Precepts; this was farre from <hi>Davids</hi> thoughts. Thus much for the explication of the Text, <hi>Deliver me from the oppre≈ø≈øion of man, ≈øo will I keepe thy Precepts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are ≈øeverall Ob≈øervations that ari≈øe from the words.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Ob≈øerve, that in all Ages there hath bin among men, oppre≈ø≈øors of men: <hi>David</hi> found op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øion in his time; yea, oppre≈ø≈øion was much elder
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:117437:6"/> then <hi>David,</hi> it is as old as the World: as ≈øoone as there could be oppre≈ø≈øion, oppre≈ø≈øion appeared, <hi>Cain</hi> oppre≈ø≈øed <hi>Abel:</hi> in the Age after the Floud, there you reade of great oppre≈ø≈øion; <hi>Nimrod</hi> was a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie Hunter before the Lord, he was the Patron of oppre≈ø≈øors, <hi>Gen.</hi> 10. 89. There is a notable oppre≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon Record, <hi>Ier.</hi> which ≈øtands to this day again≈øt Jeru≈øalem, a Citie of God, a place where the people of God did dwell, and yet you ≈øhall finde op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øion there, yea, nothing but oppre≈ø≈øion; ≈øhee is wholly oppre≈ø≈øed, ≈øome render it; <hi>Tota ip≈øa,</hi> ≈øhee is all oppre≈ø≈øed; and ≈øaith the Text, <hi>Oppre≈ø≈øion is in the mid≈øt of her, in interiori:</hi> it is not here to be meant locally, as if oppre≈ø≈øion were onely in the mid≈øt of the Citie; but in the mid≈øt of her as there is a middle in her heart, in her ≈øoule; oppre≈ø≈øion in her very ≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. As there is a ≈øpirit in man which lu≈øteth to envie, <hi>Iames</hi> 4. 5. ≈øo there is a ≈øpirit in man which lu≈øteth to oppre≈ø≈øe. An envious ≈øpirit is angry, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and vexed, when any man enjoyeth any thing that is good. An oppre≈ø≈øing ≈øpirit will not give over oppre≈ø≈øing, till it hath taken away that good which a man doth enjoy. And in this, ≈øee how man is depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the example of God: God, he is a pre≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of man, a lover of man; and ≈øo ≈øhould man be to man: but they are as the Devill is to man, a De≈øtroyer, and an Oppre≈ø≈øor: Thus are many men to men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> 2. Ob≈øerve, (from the Text) <hi>Deliver me</hi> (≈øaith <hi>David) from the oppre≈ø≈øion of man.</hi> Man hath a very heavie hand upon man: <hi>David</hi> de≈øired rather
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:117437:6"/> to be under the hand of God, then under the hand of man. The oppre≈ø≈øion of man is a very heavie op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øion, <hi>David</hi> prayeth again≈øt it with all his might: the oppre≈ø≈øion of man is very heavie; it was that which made the P≈øalmi≈øt crie out: <hi>Ari≈øe, O God, to judge the fatherle≈ø≈øe and the oppre≈ø≈øed, that the men of the world may no more oppre≈ø≈øe;</hi> the word in the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall ≈øignifieth, to <hi>terrifie.</hi> Oppre≈ø≈øion in Scripture is expre≈ø≈øed by <hi>Deva≈øtation,</hi> it is that which layeth all wa≈øte; Oppre≈ø≈øion makes a wi≈øe man mad: Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øion doth not onely ≈øpoyle a man of his outward e≈øtate, but it even bereaveth him of his wits; he is as it were di≈øtracted, di≈ø-compo≈øed, unfit for to doe God ≈øervice. There are three phra≈øes given to Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øion, in Scripture:</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, The Scripture calleth Oppre≈ø≈øion the <hi>burthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the people;</hi> which is very tedious.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Scripture calleth Oppre≈ø≈øion the <hi>grinding of the face;</hi> and that's farre wor≈øe.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Scripture calleth Oppre≈ø≈øion the <hi>eating of the fle≈øh,</hi> the <hi>gnawing of the very bones;</hi> and that is wor≈øt of all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct. 3. Deliver me from the oppre≈ø≈øion of man: David</hi> was under a feare of oppre≈ø≈øion, and therefore he addre≈ø≈øeth him≈øelfe to God: ob≈øerve, it is God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone that delivereth from oppre≈ø≈øion, he can doe it, he alone hath power to doe it, he will doe it, he hath promi≈øed to doe it, the glory of God con≈øi≈øts in it; he will doe it, for he is honoured by it; he will break the teeth of the oppre≈ø≈øors: The Lord doth this many wayes, but I will onely name three.</p>
            <pb n="8" facs="tcp:117437:7"/>
            <p>Fir≈øt, By the totall de≈øtruction and overthrow of Oppre≈ø≈øors, <hi>They ≈øhall be con≈øumed as ≈øtubble that is fully drie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, The Lord delivereth his people from oppre≈ø≈øion, by re≈øtraining the rage and malice of the Enemie, that they are not able to hurt them; <hi>Hee ≈øuffered no man to doe them any wrong,</hi> ≈øaith the Text: This implyeth, that many would have done them wrong, but God put a barre upon their power, <hi>hee ≈øuffered no man to doe them any wrong.</hi> God kept the fire from burning the three Children: How? Not by putting out the fire, but by re≈øtraining the naturall power of the fire, that it could not burne them, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. 23. God al≈øo pre≈øerved <hi>Daniel</hi> in the Lyons Denne: How? Not by de≈øtroying the Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but by taking away the Lyons appetite, hee ≈øtayed their hunger, that they did not hurt <hi>Daniel, Dan.</hi> 6. 20.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Hee delivereth his from Oppre≈ø≈øion, by changing the hearts of their Oppre≈ø≈øors, hee can make them of Enemies to become friends, <hi>E≈øay 11. 6. The Wolfe al≈øo ≈øhall dwell with the Lamb, the Leopard ≈øhall lye downe with the Kid, and the Calfe and the young Lyon and the fatling together.</hi> God can ≈øo change the Lyon, that it ≈øhall not hurt the Lamb; hee can ≈øo alter the Leopard, that it ≈øhall not hurt the Kid, but both ≈øhall lye downe together, and <hi>the Earth ≈øhall be full of the knowledge of the Lord.</hi> Wee have had great experience of the Lords delivering us from the oppre≈ø≈øion of man: the fir≈øt way, by de≈øtroying all our oppre≈ø≈øors; yea, and by the ≈øecond way, when
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:117437:7"/> our Enemies were ≈øtrong, hee hath re≈øtrained their power, that they were not able to hurt us. Now our la≈øt prayer for our Enemies ≈øhould be this, That God would change their hearts, that of Wolves they might become Lambs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> 4. The la≈øt Doctrine is this, That the Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance from the oppre≈ø≈øion of man, ≈øhould be a ≈øtrong Engagement upon us, to a new and vigorous ≈øervice of God: <hi>So will I keepe thy Precepts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Judgements call from ≈øinne, <hi>Amos 4. 10. I have brought this and evill upon you, ≈øaith the Lord, yet ye have not returned unto me:</hi> But the Voyce of Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is e≈øpecially to call to Holine≈ø≈øe, and that for the≈øe following Rea≈øons.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, Becau≈øe Deliverances are Mercies, and therefore they have this Obligation lying upon them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Deliverance from Oppre≈ø≈øion are great Mercies, and therefore it calls for more Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Wee are under the Engagements of the Lord; wee have prayed for Deliverance, and behold the Lord hath now delivered us.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, By Deliverance from our Enemies, we are freed from Incumbrances, and all Hinderances are taken away. Now wee have roome to ≈øerve God, now wee have an opportunitie to keepe Gods Precepts, now the Oppre≈ø≈øors are taken away; the enlarging of the heart is an inward helpe for the running of the wayes of thy Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <pb n="10" facs="tcp:117437:8"/>
            <p>I might give you many more Rea≈øons for the proofe of the Point, but I will winde up all in ≈øome few words of Application.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Deliver me from the oppre≈ø≈øion of man, ≈øo will I keepe thy Precepts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Right Honourable, and well-beloved, I need not tell you, that wee are a people who have formerly groaned under Oppre≈ø≈øion, under ≈øuch as would have Dominion over our Bodies, over our Cattell, over our E≈øtates, at their plea≈øure, and e≈øpecially from them which would lay heavie Yokes upon our Spirits and Con≈øciences. I need not tell you, that wee have had ≈øuch Oppre≈ø≈øors, that ≈øurely the noy≈øe of tho≈øe that groaned under them, are not gone out of our eares. Againe, I need not tell you, that wee were lately under a feare, of having Oppre≈ø≈øion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed upon us, and to have had tho≈øe to Rule over us, who≈øe little finger would have beene heavier then our former Oppre≈ø≈øors Loynes. I need not tell you of an Enemie that came like an over-flowing Floud, that would even have ≈øwallowed us up quick. I need not tell you, that wee are delivered from the≈øe mens oppre≈ø≈øions. I need not tell you, that wee have beene fearefully and wonderfully delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; that there is not onely Mercie, but Miracle in our Deliverance. How hath the Oppre≈ø≈øor cea≈øed? They are cea≈øed (ble≈ø≈øed be God) but wee can ≈øcarcely ≈øay how. I hope I need not tell you, that it is God that hath delivered us from the oppre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion of man; though God hath made u≈øe of many worthy In≈øtruments, for the accompli≈øhing this
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:117437:8"/> great Worke, which de≈øerve your chiefe≈øt commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations. I need not tell you of the≈øe things, ≈øuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing al≈øo that you will heare further concerning this particular at another time. The Deliverance that wee have now had from the oppre≈øsion of man, hath layd a mightie Engagement upon us to keepe Gods Precepts; it hath put an Engagement upon us, to keepe a Day of Pray≈øe and Thank≈ø-giving unto God; it hath put an Engagement upon us, to keepe his Precepts every day.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, ≈øome may ≈øay, True it is, wee are delivered from the oppre≈øsion of man, our Enemies are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtroyed: but, doe they ≈øay now, Come, let us keepe the Precepts of God? No, they are farre from that: Come, ≈øay they, now wee ≈øhall keepe our E≈øtates, and adde unto them; now our Trade is open, let us buy and ≈øell, and get Gaines; Though this in it ≈øelfe be lawfull, yet this is not the chiefe end that the people of God make of their Victories. <hi>Davids</hi> Re≈øolution was, Come, let us keepe the Precepts of God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, There are others that ≈øay, Wee are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from the oppre≈øsion of man, Come, let us eate and drinke, and rejoyce, wee ≈øhall not dye to morrow; wee ≈øhall now live, our Enemies are downe, wee now ≈øeeme to have a longer terme ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to our lives: ≈øurely, may ≈øome ≈øay, the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe of Death is gone.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, There are ≈øuch who are ≈øo farre from keeping the Precepts of God, by being delivered, that they take more libertie to breake the Precepts
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:117437:9"/> of God, they take libertie to breake all the bounds which God hath kept about them. Their Lu≈øts per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps were at a ≈øtand, when the Oppre≈ø≈øors held their Rods over them; but now they being delivered from the oppre≈øsion of man, doe willingly give them≈øelves over unto ≈øinne, that ≈øinne might have dominion over them. Better a thou≈øand times be under the power of a raging Enemie, then lye under the power and tyrannie of Sinne, to lye under Pride, Covetou≈øne≈ø≈øe, Envie, Malice, Drunkenne≈ø≈øe. What ≈øhall wee ≈øay to ≈øuch a Generation? There was an everla≈øting Brand put upon <hi>Ahaz:</hi> This is that <hi>Ahaz,</hi> that ≈øinned yet more and more, whil≈øt the hand of God was upon him. How ≈øhall they e≈øcape a wor≈øer Brand then <hi>Ahaz</hi> had, who notwith≈øtanding all tho≈øe glorious Deliverances which it hath plea≈øed God to vouch≈øafe unto them, yet ≈øinne more and more again≈øt him? That as God heapes Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances upon them, ≈øo they heape their ≈øinnes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt God. But before I part with the≈øe, I would willingly commend the≈øe three things to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øideration.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, Doe you thinke, that you an≈øwer the end and de≈øigne of God, in be≈øtowing the≈øe mercies upon you? <hi>Jerem.</hi> 7. 10. there is a ≈øtrange pa≈ø≈øage: Saith the Lord, <hi>They come and ≈øtand before me in this Hou≈øe, which is called by my Name, and ≈øay, Wee are delivered to doe all the≈øe abominations.</hi> Now, what were the≈øe abominations? To Steale, Murther, commit Adulterie, Sweare fal≈øely, burne Incen≈øe unto other Gods: I conceive,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:117437:9"/> there were no people in the world ≈øo wicked as to ≈øay wee have received the≈øe mercies, wee are delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from our enemies, that wee may ≈øteale, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ≈øweare fal≈øly, &amp;c. I thinke <hi>Sodom</hi> it ≈øelf would not have ≈øaid ≈øo? neither doe I believe this people here did ≈øay ≈øo, ≈øillabically or verbally, but by inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation there actions did ≈øpeake ≈øo much, every one that ≈øinneth wilfully again≈øt God, throweth a ≈øtone at God.</p>
            <p>2. Doe you think, that it is not po≈ø≈øible that you may yet need a further deliverance, is it impo≈ø≈øible that new troubles ≈øhould ari≈øe? ≈øurely no, and God may ≈øay unto you, why ≈øhould you bee deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered any more, you are re≈øolved to ≈øinne yet more and more and more, why therefore ≈øhould you bee delivered any more, ≈øince you have revolted more and more.</p>
            <p>3. From that dreadfull Scripture, 9. <hi>Ezra</hi> 13. 14. and after all this is come upon us for evill deeds, and for our great tre≈øpa≈ø≈øes, ≈øeeing that thou our God ha≈øt puni≈øhed us le≈ø≈øe then our iniquities de≈øerve, and hath given us ≈øuch deliverance as this, ≈øhould we againe break thy commandements, and joyne in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitie with the people of the≈øe abominations: would≈øt thou not bee angrie with us, till thou ha≈øt con≈øumed us? ≈øo that there ≈øhould bee no remnant nor e≈øcaping.</p>
            <p>The ≈øecond u≈øe may ≈øerve for exhortation, ≈øeeing that we are delivered from the oppre≈øsion of man, be per≈øwaded to keepe the Precepts of God, keepe them according as you heard in opening of the Text,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:117437:10"/> keepe them by way of obedience and ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion, and keepe them by way of protection, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øervation.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, Bee exhorted to keepe all the precepts of God, by way of obedience and ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion, keepe them more ≈øtrictly then you have done heretofore, how happy would it be if there were found a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple imitating that pattern, 9. <hi>Acts 31. Then had the Churches re≈øt throughout all Judea, and Galilee, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria, and were edified, and walking in the feare of the Lord, and in the comfort of the holy Gho≈øt were mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplyed.</hi> Then had the Churches re≈øt, temporal re≈øt, re≈øt from the oppre≈ø≈øors; the Churches had re≈øt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe they kept the precepts of God, they did walke in the feare of the Lord and were multiplyed: Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi≈øtrates they ≈øhould keep the precepts of judgement and ju≈øtice, <hi>Lord</hi> (≈øaith <hi>David) I have done judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ju≈øtice, therefore deliver me from my Oppre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øors.</hi> The Lord hath not left you to the Oppre≈ø≈øor, therefore doe you doe judgement and ju≈øtice. To all this Citie, I would ≈øay one word, ≈øeeing the Lord hath delivered you from the Oppre≈ø≈øion of man, love one another, take heed that God having delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red you from open oppre≈ø≈øion lets not there bee ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret oppre≈ø≈øion among yov. I would al≈øo pre≈ø≈øe you to be keeping of the commandements of God, doe not only keepe them your ≈øelves, but cau≈øe others to keep them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, You mu≈øt defend and protect the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of God, contend earne≈øtly for the faith once delived to the Saints, e≈øpecially Magi≈øtrates and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øters,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:117437:10"/> they ≈øhould keep the precepts of God; Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øters they ≈øhould defend the precepts of God by arguments, they ≈øhould redeeme them out of the hands of the Oppre≈ø≈øors, e≈øpecially, becau≈øe there are ≈øo many that doe pervert them, not only prophane per≈øons, but other Hereticall per≈øons, which bring in damnable doctrines: God expects it al≈øo from Magi≈øtrates, that they ≈øhould defend them by the ≈øword of their power, fulfill the end of God in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving you victories, keep his truth and his precepts from violence, <hi>Magi≈øtratus ≈øunt Cu≈øtodes utriu≈ø<expan>
                     <am>
                        <g ref="char:abque"/>
                     </am>
                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan> Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulae</hi> Magi≈øtrates are the keepers of both the Tables, Hath not God kept this Citie from violence and plundering, your wives from ravi≈øhing, your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren from being de≈øtroyed, your e≈øtates, your eyes from ≈øhedding teares, your feet from going downe to the Pit, therefore bee you now keepers of the Lord, the Lord hath kept us as the Apple of his eye, tho≈øe which have gone about to touch us have been de≈øtroyed, hee hath kept our peace, our per≈øons, therefore let us keep his precepts from violence, let none touch them that would wrong them, let it not be ≈øaid of you, as <hi>David</hi> had occa≈øion to ≈øay of <hi>Nabal, In vaine have I kept all that this fellow hath, that my Army hath not touched him, but bee a ≈øhelter unto him.</hi> Give not God occa≈øion to ≈øay ≈øo by you, in vaine have I kept your Citie, in vaine have I kept your E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtates, in vaine have I kept your per≈øons, for you will doe nothing for mee, you will not ≈øo much as keep my precepts, which are for your eternall good, Oh that God might have occa≈øion to ≈øay thus of us,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:117437:11"/> This people have traded well with the Mercies and Deliverances formerly be≈øtowed upon them! there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will I give them more Deliverances, I will multiply my Ble≈øsings upon them. Their Oppre≈ø≈øors ≈øhall not ri≈øe and increa≈øe fa≈øter then I will de≈øtroy them; when they ri≈øe up again≈øt them, I will ≈øcatter them before my people: their Oppre≈ø≈øors ≈øhall no more ri≈øe up again≈øt them, but you ≈øhall be a people ≈øaved by the Lord. Thus much for this time.</p>
